AWS instead of custom work?
---------------------------
- Post something to a topic
- Receive a message from the broadcast
- Do something interesting with that receive

For example:
- Server you want to monitor
- Periodically pull data from server
- Publish data to SNS
  - Receive to Lambda (yes, lambda - not heroku, and not a microframework)
    - Lambda writes the data to DynamoDB
    - Lambda computes a report (HTML, chat bot, whatever), and publishes it (to
      S3, via an API

Option 1 - Sender / receiver + page generator
---------------------------------------------
- Sender posts to SNS
- SNS pushes to receiver
- Receiver does something with data

With this design you integrate with SNS, and only write senders (HTTP) and
reciver (HTTP, which could be Sinatra, or Flask, or something similar).


Option 2 - Sender + page generator
----------------------------------

- Sender posts to SNS
- SNS pushes to Lambda
- Lambda writes to DynamoDB
- Status page generated by one of:
  - Lambda runs a static job to generate page and pushed it to S3
  - Script connects to DynamoDB via API and generates results locally
